Overview of scenario

	Since July 2022, I have been employed by AP Indie Games Production, an independent game development company where it is located in Australia. Six people make up our development team: a project manager, a programmer, a tester, a sound engineer, and 2D and 3D artists. Following a project development conversation, we accept our responsibility and the necessary paperwork. The project manager must decide what game design is required and assign the remaining tasks to the other team members. As the project manager describes plans, I, the programmer, create the code. Drawings in 2D must be done by 2D artists. As a 3D artist,  he must produce the additional animations and 3D relief graphics needed for game creation. The game's sound effects must be produced by the sound manager. As testers, he reviews the game once the project is completed to see if there are any issues or flaws. This is our game development team's scene.
	Since our work is done remotely, we collaborate on code creation with the team members using cloud services like Git. Git is a public service, and other people can view our codes worldwide. It is impossible to safeguard the code that the team members do not want others to know about.
