Overview of scenario

	Since July of 2022, I have been employed by AP Indie Games Production, an independent game development company. Australia is the country where it's located. Six people make up our development team: a project manager, a programmer, a tester, a sound engineer, and two or three artists. Following a project development conversation, we accept our responsibility and the necessary paperwork. The project manager must decide what game design is required and assigns the remaining tasks to the other team members. As the project manager describes plans, I, the programmer, create the code. Drawings in 2D must be done by 2D artists. As a 3D artist,  he must produce the additional animations and 3D relief graphics needed for game creation. The game's sound effects must be produced by the sound manager. As testers, he reviews the game once the project is completed to see if there are any issues or flaws.
